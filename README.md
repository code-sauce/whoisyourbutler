Choosing the right CI/CD tool

Performs similar operations on different CI/CDs. 
Currently evaluating:

* CircleCI
* Travis
* Codeship

Since we already use Jenkins, evaluating it will not be very useful.

Evaluation criteria:

* Automated tests on Github commits
* Deployment features like putting an artifact into S3 (on a private AWS account)
* node tests, optionally a UI headless browser test
